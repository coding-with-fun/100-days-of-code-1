### R1 Day 0: September 25 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**
- Started with a new course [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)

**Thoughts**: Today I mainly found the courses to learn from basic level of JavaScript and accelerate to the advanced level.
